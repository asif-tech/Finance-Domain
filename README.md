**Finance Domain Data Analysis Using SQL**

In this project, I leveraged SQL Server to analyze a comprehensive dataset from the finance domain. The key objectives were to generate actionable insights and improve decision-making processes. Key highlights of the project include:

**Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Processed over 299,876 records by identifying and handling missing values, resulting in a refined dataset of 287,163 records.

**KPI Analysis:** Extracted key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total loan applications, monthly trends, funded amounts, and interest rates..

**Loan Categorization:** Segmented loans into 'good' and 'bad' categories based on repayment status, providing a clear comparison of performance metrics.

**Visualizations:** Created detailed dashboards in Excelto illustrate trends and insights, making complex data easily understandable for stakeholders.

This project showcases my ability to handle large datasets, perform in-depth analyses, and present findings in a clear and actionable manner.
